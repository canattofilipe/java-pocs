# Pillars of Observability

## Logs
- **Helps in Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**
- **Reduces Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**

## Metrics
- **Golden Signals:**
  - **Latency:** The time it takes for a request to be processed.
  - **Error Rate:** The percentage of requests that result in an error.
  - **Request Rate:** The number of requests per unit of time.
  - **Saturation:** The utilization of resources, such as CPU and memory, relative to their total capacity.

## Tracing
- **Allows following the path of a request through different services and components, identifying where delays or failures occur.**
